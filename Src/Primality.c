	// Using Heron's method to calculate isqrt(S).
	// Iteration rule is x_{n+1}=floor((x_n+S/x_n)/2)
	// Stop when x_{i+1}>=x_i as x_i is correct answer.
	// According to references the initial estimate is important
	// for efficiently. Problem is how to calculate good estimate
	// without that estimate calculation taking away performance.
	// Estimate has to be more then isqrt(S) to estimation to
	// converge.
	//
	// Wikipedia example just calculates half of the initial value
	// which is fast. Other one calculates ceil(2^(log2(n)/2)) which
	// is the smallest power of two bigger than or equal to isqrt(S).
	// With ceil(2^(log2(S)/2)) as initial estimate log2(log2(S)) loop
	// iterations are performed. Wikipedia has example where half
	// version needs 13 iterations for 2000000. The ceil(2^(log2(S)/2))
	// version needs 4.
	//
	// Calculation of 2^x is just bit-shifting operation on 0x1 so log2
	// is the bottle neck. Stackoverflow has pretty good list of algorithms.
	// Best one is to use __builtin_clz which is GCC and Clang specific so
	// for backup have the halving version. (There are other algorithms in
	// stackoverflow list to consider for integer log2 but one could just
	// could test dividing by four for initial estimate x_0 and get better
	// results.)
	//
	// __builtin_clz gives number of zeros after most significant bit. This
	// has relation to log2 by equation log2(x)=w-1-clz(x) where w is
	// types length in bits.
	// NOTE: stdbit.h coming in C23.
